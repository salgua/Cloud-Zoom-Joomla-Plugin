What is Cloud Zoom Joomla Plugin?
---------------------------------

Cloud Zoom Joomla Plugin is a content plugin for Joomla 1.5.
This plugin allows you to use the Cloud Zoom free jQuery image zoom plugin
of Professor Cloud (www.professorcloud.com) in your joomla website in a very
simple way.

Requirements
------------

Cloud Zoom Joomla Plugin V0.1 is tested only on Joomla 1.5 

Documentation
-------------
Install the plugin from a zip file using the joomla installer. Then you  
can embed a zoomable image using the following syntax in your article:
{cloudzoom | img='path/to/bigimage.jpg' | title='title of image' | ref='Cloud Zoom Parameters'}

Example:
{cloudzoom | img='/images/stories/monster.jpg' | title='Ducati monster' | rel='adjustX: 10, adjustY:-4'}

IMPORTANT: you need a smaller image with the same name of the big one and with the suffix _small
in the same directory. Example: if your big image is monster.jpg, you need a smaller image with 
the name monster_small.jpg in the same directory.
